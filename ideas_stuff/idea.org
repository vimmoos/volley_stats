* VOLLEY STATS
** LOGIN
*** code from
    loginpage from
    https://www.listendata.com/2019/06/how-to-add-login-page-in-shiny-r.html
    maybe it's better to use Docker-based shinyproxy package which
    maybe are better in terms of security cause right now the password
    are same as plain text in the code ...

*** Permission
    login for now there are 2 permission level
    + basic
      it should be allowed only to see stats
    + advanced
      it should be able to see and upload stats but not to modify it
    + admin
      not here yet, but it should be able to see, collect and modify data and stats
      also could be usefull to see the trafic and other stats of the website
** TODO modules
   in general the website will be based on modules which can be add
   and deleted (something like nestor which i really like!) (save the
   configuration of it based on the user so that
   next time the same user login the configuration should be restored)
   + Attack (wp)
   + Serve (wp)
   + Pass (wp)
   + Ball distribution (TODO)
   + Block (TODO)


** stats
*** Player
    + select player
    + select game
    + modules
      + Attack
      + Serve
      + Pass
      + Ball distribution
      + Block

*** Team
    + select position
    + select game
    + modules
      same as in Player (?)

** trends
   i need temporal information to do that !!
   in general this section should highlight the progression of the
   team/player across time on each of the statistics that we are
   keeping track of
*** Player
    + same selection possibility as in Player stats
    + module  TODO

*** Team
    + same selection possibility as in Team stats
    +  module TODO

** Data
   we have to add :
   + Setter
     would be great to know who was the setter in a specific set
   + date for each game
   + Team
   + Position
     this can be done as a separate file with maps player to
     position
   + Block
     maybe we can also add block error? which  I think is the only
     thing that is missing in order to have some kind of share
     structure between attack serve and block
