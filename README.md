    - Metrics include attack efficiency, serve reception quality, blocking effectiveness, and serving accuracy.
- **Interactive Visualizations:**
    - Visualize data through interactive plots and charts, such as bar graphs and violin plots.
    - Gain a clear understanding of performance distributions and identify areas for improvement.
- **Trend Analysis:**
    - Track performance trends over multiple games using line graphs and regression models.
    - Monitor player and team progress and make informed decisions based on historical data.
- **Data Upload and Management:**
    - Easily upload game data using CSV files.
    - Download CSV templates to ensure data consistency.
    - Create and manage team rosters and player information.
- **Secure User Authentication:**
